Cybertruck simulator

Implemented the blackboard
Added the end screen with stats

Must happen
- Camera needs to slowly rotate to behind the vehicle
- Settings with master volume
~~- Countown timer final seconds sound and appearance change~~
- Town design
- Volume control slider
	- Put it in it's own page titled Settings
	- Put it in a 2-column grid just like the score screen with the title on the left and a back button at the bottom of settings
	- Make the slider about 64 pixels high, light gray background, black foreground. It'll look similar to the preloader slider but more narrow.
	- Collision sound should play on release of the slider with the mouse rather than every time it moves, keyboard behaviour is fine

Possibly must happen
- Achievements that pop up after the tally
- Achievements page

Ideas
- Gas pedal stuck, tap to reset
- Controller support
- Boombox with Pedestrian Tactics music
- House with muffled PT music
- Title screen
- Invisible achievements that pop up when you get them
	- Doge coins to collect
	- Find Elon
	- Don't move at all
	- Travel a mile without hitting anything
	- Hit over X amount of objects (lots of lawsuits)
- Billboard that says it hurts in Japanese
