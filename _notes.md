Cybertruck simulator

Latest changes:
Just tested a system to create spawn points from empties in blender. This is tested in the world_spawner script which is attached to the parent scene, which is being tested in the play screen. 
- Select all the objects including the empties in Blender
- Join the objects so they form one mesh, this will ensure all the material slots are intact
- Export the world as a glb
- Import in Blender
- The script can target the empties by name and spawn an object there
