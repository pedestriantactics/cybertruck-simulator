Cybertruck simulator

Latest changes:
Just tested a system to create spawn points from empties in blender. This is tested in the world_spawner script which is attached to the parent scene, which is being tested in the play screen. 
- Select all the objects including the empties in Blender
- Join the objects so they form one mesh, this will ensure all the material slots are intact
- Export the world as a glb
- Import in Blender
- The script can target the empties by name and spawn an object there
Moved volume to it's own settings screen
New countdown timer and animation

Must happen
- The counter at the end screen needs to be shortened, it's taking too long
- Camera needs to slowly rotate to behind the vehicle
- Neighborhood design
- Updated car hit sound with random horn noise

Possibly
- Doge coin that randomly instantiates every game, game logs how many you've collected in the save file
- Achievements that pop up after the tally
- Achievements page
- Cars move

Ideas
- Gas pedal stuck, tap to reset
- Controller support
- Boombox with Pedestrian Tactics music
- House with muffled PT music
- Title screen
- Invisible achievements that pop up when you get them
	- Doge coins to collect
	- Find Elon
	- Don't move at all
	- Travel a mile without hitting anything
	- Hit over X amount of objects (lots of lawsuits)
- Billboard that says it hurts in Japanese
