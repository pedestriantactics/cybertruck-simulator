## Installation
Head over to the [releases](https://github.com/pedestriantactics/cybertruck-simulator/releases) tab and download the latest version for Mac or Windows.
**Keep in mind** the Mac version will be blocked by Gatekeeper for the pre-release versions. To bypass this, right-click on the app after moving it out of the .dmg and click open. This will give you the option to open it anyway.
